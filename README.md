# Animated Pickup

Aimates item pickup from the game world. This change adds more juice to the game and makes picking up items more satisfying.

Inspired by a similar feature in Borderlands 2. For a full Borderlands 2-like looting experience I recommend Gerotaritor's [Loot Detector](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53947).


# Usage

You can obtain the mod on its [Nexusmods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54532).
