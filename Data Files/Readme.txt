Description
____________

Animates item pickup from the game world. Inspired by a similar feature in Borderlands 2. For a full Borderlands 2-like looting experience I recommend Gerotaritor's Loot Detector (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53947).

If you are looking for a similar mod for OpenMW, I recommend excellent OpenMW Animated Pickup and Sneak to Steal (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54585) by taitechnic.

Initial Release.
1.0.1
Bugfix: Don't play the pickup animation for items that have scripts. This prevents weird issues with items such as the Dwemer Puzzle Cube which can only be picked up after a certain quest entry has been met.
Bugfix: Don't play the pickup animation when the inventory menu is open.
